# Inline Text Editing Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented inline text editing for all text elements in the presentation slides. This feature allows users to click on any text element in a slide and edit it directly, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly editing experience.

## Implementation Details

### New Component: `EditableText`

I created a new component called `EditableText` that handles both display and edit modes for text elements:

- In display mode, it shows the text content with a hover effect to indicate it's editable
- When clicked, it switches to an editable textarea
- Pressing Enter or clicking outside saves the changes
- Pressing Escape cancels the edit and reverts to the original text

The component is flexible and can be used for different types of text elements:
- Slide titles and subtitles
- Bullet point items
- Image captions

### Integration with SlideEditor

I modified the `SlideEditor` component to use the new `EditableText` component for all text elements across different slide types.

### State Management

The feature leverages the existing `UPDATE_SLIDE` action in the PresentationContext, ensuring that all text edits are properly saved in the application state.

## User Experience

1. **Editing Text**: Users simply click on any text element to edit it directly in place
2. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects indicate which elements are editable
3. **Keyboard Controls**:
   - Enter: Save changes and exit edit mode
   - Escape: Cancel edits and revert to original text
   - Tab: Navigate between editable elements (browser default behavior)

## Technical Approach

- Used React's useState hook to manage edit mode state
- Implemented useRef to handle focus management for input elements
- Created a responsive text area that adapts to content length
- Added styling for better visual feedback during editing

## Future Enhancements

This implementation lays the groundwork for more advanced text editing features that could be added in the future:

1. Rich text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
2. Text alignment options
3. Font size and color controls
4. Undo/redo functionality for edits
5. Support for multi-line text with preserved formatting

## Testing

The implementation has been tested across all slide types to ensure proper functionality:
- Text is successfully edited and saved
- UI provides appropriate feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- State updates correctly reflect the edited content
