# Development Notes

## May 13, 2025 - Complete Rewrite and Optimization

### Issue Identified
We identified a critical bug in the previous implementation where deleting slides and uploading images caused unexpected state changes. When users would delete a slide and then upload an image, the application would revert previous slides back to their original state, effectively losing user changes.

### Action Taken
We decided to completely rewrite the application with a more robust architecture. Key changes:

1. **State Management Overhaul**
   - Implemented a proper reducer pattern to manage state changes
   - Created a centralized context for presentation state
   - Used immutable state updates throughout
   - Clear action types for all operations

2. **UI Redesign**
   - Adopted a three-panel layout similar to professional presentation software
   - Created a slide navigator in the left panel
   - Implemented a central slide editor
   - Added a tools panel with accordions on the right

3. **Image Management Improvement**
   - Developed a dedicated image library that allows image reuse
   - Implemented proper image validation and processing
   - Prepared for drag-and-drop functionality

4. **Component Structure**
   - Completely refactored components into smaller, focused pieces
   - Created a clear separation of concerns
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

### Current Status
The basic framework is in place with:
- Slide management (add, delete, duplicate, reorder)
- Image library functionality
- Template selection system
- Main editing interface

### Next Steps
1. **Implement Content Editing Features**
   - Add inline text editing functionality
   - Implement proper image placement/replacement
   - Add text formatting controls

2. **Add Full Drag-and-Drop Support**
   - Enable drag-and-drop for slides in the navigator
   - Implement drag from image library to slide content
   - Add visual cues for drag operations

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Implement local storage saving
   - Add presentation management
   - Create export functionality

## Known Technical Debt

1. **Incomplete Image Handling**
   - The image upload works but doesn't handle all edge cases
   - No image optimization is performed
   - Limited error handling for file operations

2. **Limited Editing Capabilities**
   - The slide editor currently only displays content but doesn't allow inline editing
   - No rich text formatting support yet
   - Placeholder handling needs improvement

3. **Minimal Error Handling**
   - Need to add proper error boundaries
   - More comprehensive validation for user actions
   - Better feedback for failed operations

## Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Choice**
   - We chose React Context + Reducer over Redux for simplicity
   - Used functional components and hooks throughout

2. **Component Design**
   - Opted for a clear three-panel layout inspired by desktop apps
   - Used accordions in the right panel to maximize space
   - Designed for desktop-first (mobile support can be added later)

3. **State Structure**
   - Centralized slide data and current selection
   - Separated image library from slides to support reuse
   - Used unique IDs for all entities to ensure proper tracking

## Testing Notes

The current implementation should be tested carefully for:
- State consistency when performing multiple operations
- Proper slide management when adding/deleting/reordering
- Image upload functionality with various file types and sizes
- Template selection and correct slide creation
- Navigation between slides

## Performance Considerations

- The current design should handle dozens of slides without issue
- Image handling uses base64 encoding which may cause memory issues with many large images
- Consider implementing virtualization for the slide navigator if supporting very large presentations
