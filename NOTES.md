# Development Notes

## May 13, 2025 - Slide Template Improvements

### Issue Identified
Identified issues with image grid templates (9-image and 4-image grids) where:
- Images were not fitting properly within the 9x16 slide dimensions
- External image placeholders were creating overflow problems
- Title placement was taking up too much space
- Grid cell proportions were inconsistent

### Improvements Made
1. **Better Image Placeholder Handling**
   - Removed external placeholder images that were causing sizing issues
   - Implemented custom styled placeholders with minimal text
   - Added proper aspect ratio handling for grid cells

2. **Improved Layout for Grid Templates**
   - Adjusted padding and gaps to maximize usable space
   - Fixed image overflow problems
   - Ensured all content fits within slide boundaries

3. **Enhanced Title Handling**
   - Made titles optional with a toggle button
   - Moved titles to the bottom of slide for more screen space
   - Added semi-transparent background for better readability
   - Reduced font size for better proportions

4. **Data Structure Improvements**
   - Updated data structure to use keyed objects for easier image reference
   - Added support for toggling title visibility

### Next Steps
- Implement drag-and-drop for images between library and slides
- Add text formatting options
- Consider adding more template variations

## May 13, 2025 - Inline Text Editing Implementation

### Feature Added
Implemented inline text editing functionality for all text elements in slides. This feature allows users to click on any text element and edit it directly on the slide, providing a more intuitive editing experience.

### Implementation Details
- Created a new EditableText component that handles both display and edit modes
- Updated SlideEditor to use EditableText for all text elements
- Added keyboard shortcuts for saving (Enter) and canceling (Escape) edits
- Implemented visual feedback for editable elements

See `docs/INLINE_TEXT_EDITING.md` for comprehensive documentation.

## May 13, 2025 - Complete Rewrite and Optimization

### Issue Identified
We identified a critical bug in the previous implementation where deleting slides and uploading images caused unexpected state changes. When users would delete a slide and then upload an image, the application would revert previous slides back to their original state, effectively losing user changes.

### Action Taken
We decided to completely rewrite the application with a more robust architecture. Key changes:

1. **State Management Overhaul**
   - Implemented a proper reducer pattern to manage state changes
   - Created a centralized context for presentation state
   - Used immutable state updates throughout
   - Clear action types for all operations

2. **UI Redesign**
   - Adopted a three-panel layout similar to professional presentation software
   - Created a slide navigator in the left panel
   - Implemented a central slide editor
   - Added a tools panel with accordions on the right

3. **Image Management Improvement**
   - Developed a dedicated image library that allows image reuse
   - Implemented proper image validation and processing
   - Prepared for drag-and-drop functionality

4. **Component Structure**
   - Completely refactored components into smaller, focused pieces
   - Created a clear separation of concerns
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

### Current Status
The basic framework is in place with:
- Slide management (add, delete, duplicate, reorder)
- Image library functionality
- Template selection system
- Main editing interface
- Inline text editing for all text elements
- Improved slide templates with optimized layouts

### Next Steps
1. **Implement Additional Content Editing Features**
   - Add text formatting controls (bold, italic, etc.)
   - Implement proper image placement/replacement with drag-and-drop

2. **Add Full Drag-and-Drop Support**
   - Enable drag-and-drop for slides in the navigator
   - Implement drag from image library to slide content
   - Add visual cues for drag operations

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Implement local storage saving
   - Add presentation management
   - Create export functionality

## Known Technical Debt

1. **Incomplete Image Handling**
   - The image upload works but doesn't handle all edge cases
   - No image optimization is performed
   - Limited error handling for file operations

2. **Limited Editing Capabilities**
   - No rich text formatting support yet
   - Placeholder handling needs improvement

3. **Minimal Error Handling**
   - Need to add proper error boundaries
   - More comprehensive validation for user actions
   - Better feedback for failed operations

## Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Choice**
   - We chose React Context + Reducer over Redux for simplicity
   - Used functional components and hooks throughout

2. **Component Design**
   - Opted for a clear three-panel layout inspired by desktop apps
   - Used accordions in the right panel to maximize space
   - Designed for desktop-first (mobile support can be added later)

3. **State Structure**
   - Centralized slide data and current selection
   - Separated image library from slides to support reuse
   - Used unique IDs for all entities to ensure proper tracking

## Testing Notes

The current implementation should be tested carefully for:
- State consistency when performing multiple operations
- Proper slide management when adding/deleting/reordering
- Image upload functionality with various file types and sizes
- Template selection and correct slide creation
- Navigation between slides
- Text editing functionality across all slide types
- Image grid layouts at different screen sizes

## Performance Considerations

- The current design should handle dozens of slides without issue
- Image handling uses base64 encoding which may cause memory issues with many large images
- Consider implementing virtualization for the slide navigator if supporting very large presentations
