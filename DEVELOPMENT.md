# Development Notes

## Project Status

We've created a new branch `feature/rebuild-optimized` to rebuild the presentation builder from scratch with a better architecture. The previous implementation had issues with state management that caused bugs when deleting slides and uploading images.

## Current Implementation

- Three-panel layout with:
  - Left panel: Slide navigator (PowerPoint/Keynote style)
  - Center panel: Slide editor
  - Right panel: Tools with accordions for image library and template selection
- State management using React Context and reducers
- Basic slide management functionality
- Image library with upload capabilities
- Template library with 7 slide types

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement drag-and-drop for images from the library to slides
2. Add inline text editing directly on slides
3. Implement slide content updates in the state

### Future Enhancements
1. Save/load functionality for presentations
2. Presentation preview mode
3. Export options (PDF, images)
4. More customization options for each slide type

## Known Issues
- Image drop zones need to be implemented
- Text editing functionality not yet implemented
- Layout could use refinement on different screen sizes

## Development Decisions

### Architecture
- Using React Context API for state management to ensure consistent state updates
- Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Centralized slide templates definition
- Image handling utilities separated from UI components

### UI Design
- Three-panel layout inspired by professional presentation software
- Accordion menus to maximize available space
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Familiar interactions for users of PowerPoint/Keynote
